# Scripts INSPIRE UTC

These are the scripts I used in my time working for Inspire UTC. All these scripts relate to Unity and git setups to make the process faster because I got tired of writing the same commands hundreds of times.

# How to use
* Clone this repo somewhere onto your pc, I recommend the root of the C: drive.
* Add this folder to your user path variables (admin will prevent system variables smh)
* to run scripts simply type `script_name.bat` in git bash once you cd to where you want to use them.
* Profit $$$

# Included Scripts

*generate-unity-gitignore.bat* - Generates the Unity gitignore from github (So you don't include all that extra garbage that fricks up people who clone)
*track-large.bat* - You will be working with lots of large files, this script will automatically add all files above 50MB to git lfs (make sure you have git lfs installed)
